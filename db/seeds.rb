# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  Student.create(first_name: "Garry", last_name: "Clerge")
  Student.create(first_name: "Tom", last_name: "Jenkins")
  Student.create(first_name: "Max", last_name: "Wilkons")
  Student.create(first_name: "Sarah", last_name: "James")
  Student.create(first_name: "Phil", last_name: "Comely")
  Student.create(first_name: "Rachel", last_name: "Shwartz")
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
